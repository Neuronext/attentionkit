    "Back to the full spectra, we can also look at how this changes over time in a single image. ",
    "This image, with time on the horizontal x-axis and freqency on the vertical y-axis is like a heat map or topographic map. ",
    "The most recent data is on the right side",
    "Lighter regions are frequencies with larger power. ",
    "Remember that on the frequency spectra power is the vertical dimension, here on the spectrogram the height of that line is shown as the lightness.",
    "This plot is showing only data from the left frontal electrode AF7"
